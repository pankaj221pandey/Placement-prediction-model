## Introduction

The Student Placement Prediction Model aims to predict student placements using different machine learning algorithms, including SVM, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes. The project compares the performance of these algorithms to identify the best model for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features related to students' academic performance, personal details, and other relevant information.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-placement-prediction-model.git
cd student-placement-prediction-model
```

Place the dataset file in the repository directory.

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```
## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values and data types.
- Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder or one-hot encoding.
- Normalizing numerical features.
- Splitting the data into training and test sets.
  
## Model Training

The models trained in this project include:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

Each model is trained and evaluated to compare their performance.

## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics. The performance of each model is compared to determine the best one for student placement prediction.

## Results
The results of the model training and evaluation include accuracy scores and other performance metrics. The comparison shows the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Conclusion
Based on the comparison:

- Naive Bayes is better for avoiding overfitting.
- Logistic Regression is better for accuracy.
- SVM provides high accuracy with low variance in scores.

Therefore, the SVM model is chosen as the best-suited model for student placement prediction due to its high accuracy and low variance.
